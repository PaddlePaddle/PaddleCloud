# Design

## Motivation
[PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/paddlepaddle) is a widely used machine learning framework in China. 
However there is no easy way to launch PaddlePaddle training jobs on Kubernetes. 
By providing a CRD and a custom controller, we can make PaddlePaddle distributed training simple for end users. For more information about PaddlePaddle, please check our [website](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/).

## Goals
Users of kubernetes should be able to run training using PaddlePaddle easily on Kubernetes. 
This will be implemented by using Kubernetes operator. 
An end user can run training jobs with PaddlePaddle on local or cloud.

The proposal defines the followings:

* Provide a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for defining PaddlePaddle training job, currently supports running two distributed tasks, ParameterServer (PS) and Collective.
* Implement a controller to manage the CRD, create dependent resources, and reconcile to the desired states.
* The script for operator and controller deployment.
* Several distributed PaddlePaddle training examples.

## Non-Goals
For the model serving part, it will not be included in the paddle-operator.

## API (CRD and resulting objects)

        |-- crd.yaml
        `-- operator.yaml
```

### Custom Resource Definition
The custom resource definition yaml example is as following:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch.paddlepaddle.org/v1
kind: PaddleJob
metadata:
  name: wide-ande-deep
spec:
  withGloo: 1
  intranet: PodIP
  cleanPodPolicy: OnCompletion
  worker:
    replicas: 2
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: paddle
            image: registry.baidubce.com/paddle-operator/demo-wide-and-deep:v1
  ps:
    replicas: 2
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: paddle
            image: registry.baidubce.com/paddle-operator/demo-wide-and-deep:v1
```

* The optional configuration of withGloo is 0 not enabled, 1 only starts the worker side, 2 starts all (worker and server), it is recommended to set 1;
* The cleanPodPolicy can be optionally configured as Always/Never/OnFailure/OnCompletion, which indicates whether to delete the pod when the task is terminated (failed or successful). It is recommended to Never during debugging and OnCompletion during production;
* The intranet can be optionally configured as Service/PodIP, which means the communication method between pods. The user does not need to configure it, and PodIP is used by default;
* The content of ps and worker is podTemplateSpec. Users can add more content according to the Kubernetes specification, such as GPU configuration.

We also provide PaddlePaddle collective mode with GPU.

```
apiVersion: batch.paddlepaddle.org/v1
kind: PaddleJob
metadata:
  name: resnet
spec:
  cleanPodPolicy: Never
  worker:
    replicas: 2
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: paddle
            image: registry.baidubce.com/paddle-operator/demo-resnet:v1
            command:
            - python
            args:
            - "-m"
            - "paddle.distributed.launch"
            - "train_fleet.py"
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /dev/shm
              name: dshm
            resources:
              limits:
                nvidia.com/gpu: 1
        volumes:
        - name: dshm
          emptyDir:
            medium: Memory
```

* Here you need to add shared memory to mount to prevent cache errors;
* This example uses the built-in data set. After the program is started, it will be downloaded. Depending on the network environment, it may wait a long time.

### Resulting coordinator
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

  - apiVersion: batch.paddlepaddle.org/v1

    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 2379
  selector:

```yaml

```

### Resulting Worker
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wide-ande-deep-worker-0
  namespace: paddle-system
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: batch.paddlepaddle.org/v1
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    controller: true
    kind: PaddleJob
    name: wide-ande-deep

  resourceVersion: "9507629"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/paddle-system/pods/wide-ande-deep-worker-0
  uid: e8534fe6-7c2e-4849-9a99-ffdcd5df76bb
spec:
  containers:
  - env:
    - name: POD_IP
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          apiVersion: v1
          fieldPath: status.podIP
    - name: PADDLE_TRAINER_ID
      value: "0"
    - name: TRAINING_ROLE
      value: TRAINER
    - name: PADDLE_TRAINING_ROLE
      value: TRAINER
    envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: wide-ande-deep
    image: registry.baidubce.com/paddle-operator/demo-wide-and-deep:v1
```

The worker spec generates a pod. Currently worker will communicate to the coordinator through the coordinator's service name, we'll use a service registry for service discovery.

## Feautre highlists

The paddle-operator provide 3 intranet network mode which allows program communication inter-pods.

| intranet | pros | cons | align |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service | standard, fault-tolerant | port specified, bad performance | tf-operator, pytorch-operator |
| PodIP | standard, easy configure | bad performance | mpi-operator |
| HostNetwork | high performance | port conflit | - |
